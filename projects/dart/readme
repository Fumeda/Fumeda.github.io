Dartboard is a fun minigame website I (Fumeda) am making out of boredom. It is not meant to ever be fully completed,
instead I would be constantly adding fun new things as I come up with ideas.

todo:
c- gamemodes
c- border around screen when clicking succesfully/failing
c- proper end-screen
c- proper start-screen
c- more stats
c- click cooldown
c- customization

~-------~

other ideas:
c- random chaos modifiers
o-- flashbang
o-- party mode (random tint on screen)
o-- spin dartboard
o-- scale entire window
o-- some kind of blocker that reduces points when clicked (wet trout)

c- dev mode
c- music
c- point system based on time, clicks, modifier usage
c- add php to record scores to database (if logged or something)
c- leaderboard on end-screen
