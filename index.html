        <h3 id='aboutme'>ABOUT ME - what you should probably know about me</h3>
        <p>hello, this is my website where I store most things I made for fun or as a test of my abilities. I
            consider
            myself decent at learning new things, which is why I want to showcase some variety on here. If you find
            anything on here interesting and wanna talk with me, feel free to contact me on Discord or through mail.</p>
        <h4>BIO - what you probably shouldn't know about me</h4>
        <p>i don't wanna host a blog so i'm just gonna dump my thoughts and things about me on here, but really just
            skip this it's gonna be
            boring.</p>
        <h4>SOCIALS - where you could contact me (or just snoop around if applicable)</h4>
        <table class="social-links">
            <tr>
                <td>kubasliwa111@gmail.com<img height="16px" src="img/mail.png" alt="mail-icon "></td>

            </tr>
        </table>
        <h3 id='projects'>PROJECTS - here's some things i've worked on and want to show</h3>
        <h4><a href="projects/dart/" class='cl'>DARTS</a></h4>
        <p>just like real life darts, except you throw at near light speed and your accuracy might be a bit better.
            planned to have a couple gamemodes and extra features, but I've got a lot of other things to do so it's
            in a
            demo state instead. made purely with html css and js</p>
        <h4><a href="projects/messageboard/" class='cl'>MESSAGEBOARD</a></h4>
        <p>a messageboard! you can write messages, reply to users and even use images. just don't do anything
            improper
            so I don't have to close this down. originally made for a graded project that tested our knowledge on
            basic
            php methods. the styling might be a bit off but it's something.</p>
        <h4>HAMMER MAP - PF_DESEVIDERES</h4>
        <p>a Team Fortress 2 map made in hammer++ for the gamemode Parkour Fortress. TF2 and PF are both something I
            really enjoyed which is why I wanted to make this. I have not yet finished it and as
            such the files aren't released, but I can show off some pictures atleast! [ sorry, no early dev pics :c
            ]
        </p>
        <img src="img/desevideres/1.png" alt="image1">
        <img src="img/desevideres/2.png" alt="image2">
        <img src="img/desevideres/3.png" alt="image3">
        <p>creativity is a bit of an issue for me so what I'd do is throw random blocks together then test how it
            felt
            in gameplay. If I ended up liking it I added more and if I didn't I'd try a different arrangement.
            Because
            of this method the map's likely gonna be pretty solid for gameplay but less visually appealing as some
            configurations might seem unnatural [ although I did try my best to fit things together ]</p>
        <h4>NAME PENDING</h4>
        <p>I don't know what to call this game, as I am not certain on what it's gonna be yet, but I'm putting this
            here
            to show that I'm currently learning Godot [ using GDScript ] and game dev in general. It's supposed to
            be
            something simple in 2D that I'd be able to expand over time into something greater. Maybe check back
            some
            other day?</p>
        <h4>ANDROID APPS</h4>
        <p>I made some mobile apps utilizing Flutter and Dart! I'll put them on here soon as apks, promise.</p>
