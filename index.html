        <h3 id='aboutme'>ABOUT ME - what you should probably know about me</h3>
        <p>Scroll down or click the buttons above to see the projects. If you're still here, hello, this is
            my website where I store most things I made for fun or as a test of my abilities. I consider myself decent
            at learning new things, which is why I want to showcase some variety on here. If you find anything on here
            interesting and wanna talk about it, feel free to contact me anywhere</p>
        <h4>BIO - what you probably shouldn't know about me</h4>
        i don't wanna host a blog so i'm just gonna dump my thoughts on here, but really just skip this it's gonna be
        boring.<br>
        so
        <h4>SOCIALS - where you could contact me (or just snoop around if applicable)</h4>

        <h4><a href="projects/dart.html" class='cl'>DARTS</a></h4>
        <p>just like real life darts, except you throw at near light speed and your accuracy might be a bit better.
            planned to have a couple gamemodes and extra features, but i've got a lot of other things to do so it's in a
            demo state</p>
        <h4><a href="projects/messageboard.php" class='cl'>MESSAGEBOARD</a></h4>
        <p>a messageboard! you can write messages, reply to users and even use images. just don't do anything improper
            so i don't have to close this down. originally made for a graded project that tested our knowledge on basic
            php methods</p>
